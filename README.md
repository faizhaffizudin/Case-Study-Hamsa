#### Identify:
  - Identified as User Controllable HTML Element Attribute.
  - The risk level is low.
  - Classified as CWE ID:20
  - The page involved is at URL: https://www.mohe.gov.my/korporat/profil-korporat 
#### Evaluate:
  - Passive
  - This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. 
  - This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.
  - User-controlled HTML attribute values were found. 
  - The user-controlled value was 10. 
#### Prevent:
  - Try injecting special characters to see if XSS might be possible.
  - Validate all input and sanitize output it before writing to any HTML attributes.

Information disclosure is a vulnerability that can jeopardize the security of sensitive data in a web application. The vulnerability found in this situation is known as "Information Disclosure - Suspicious Comments." It refers to source code comments that might reveal sensitive information to an attacker. These suspicious comments may assist an attacker in obtaining information in some circumstances. The attacker can get further information about the web application by studying source code fragments and comments. 
#### Evaluate:
The risk level for this alert is informational and the Common Weakness Enumeration(CWE) is CWE-200. According to CWE by the Mitre Organisation, it is one of the most significant downward movers in 2022, falling from #20 in 2021 to #33. The total number of National Vulnerability Database(NVD)s is 241, and the average CVSS score is 5.99. As a result, CWE-200 has a medium severity rating, indicating that the web application may be vulnerable to a possible attack.

#### Prevent:
1. Identify the suspicious comments
    -The first step in resolving this issue is to locate the suspicious code comments. These comments might contain sensitive information, debugging information, or        other facts that an attacker could use to uncover weaknesses in the web application.

2. Remove the suspicious comments
    -Once the suspicious comments are identified, the following step is to delete them from the source code. Sensitive information should never be kept in comments          since anybody with access to the source code may readily access it. Just make sure that any sensitive information is removed before committing the code.

3. Implement proper authentication and authorization 
    -Proper authentication and authorization must be implemented to secure the web application. This will ensure that critical information and functionality are only        accessible to authorized individuals.

4. Make use of HTTPS
    -HTTPS is required for secure communication between the client and the server since it encrypts all data transmitted between the client and the server.
